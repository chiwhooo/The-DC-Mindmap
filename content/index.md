title: The DC Mindmap
---
This is a labour of love produced by Tumblr user [@halitis](https://www.tumblr.com/halitis) for a university project. It is a on-going collection of comic stories and comic recaps. This is all handled by one person, so please be gentle and try to have reasonable expectations for how much can be updated at a time :)

For more technological updates and university work, find my website [here](https://chiwhooo.wordpress.com/)

For other websites like this, I recommend the [DC Continuity Project](http://www.dccontinuityproject.com/) and the [DC Database](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/DC_Comics_Database). These were some of the inspirations behind this project are the work of many individuals, cannot recommend more to check out!
