Dryg is red gorilla-like creature, who has a height of sixty feet (eighteen metres) tall. He lived on the planet of [[Calor]] before being vanquished by [[Harold 'Hal' Jordan]]. Dryg had the ability of a very strong mental energy, which was capable of draining Hal's will and interrupting his ring's ability to hit him. He was, however, weak to the cold and ice due to his typical heated habitat.
