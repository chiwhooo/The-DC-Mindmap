Hal first debuted as a character in 1959, and while he was not the first Green Lantern; he was the first Green Lantern to be associated with the [[Green Lantern Corps]].

Hal gets his powers after [[Abin Sur]] crash lands on Earth, and as his dying command he orders the ring to find a new wielder who is "a deserving earthman ... He must be one without fear! Entirely without fear!". Hal fits the requirements and the ring summons him to the crashsite of Abin who rushes through an explanation of the ring before passing on.
