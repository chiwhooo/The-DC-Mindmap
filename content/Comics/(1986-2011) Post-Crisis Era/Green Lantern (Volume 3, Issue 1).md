The comic starts with [[Harold 'Hal' Jordan]] reminiscing on his current life, dealing with his despair with his current life before flying to the current [[Justice League of America]] headquarters. He runs into [[Bruce Wayne]] who reminds Hal that he is always welcome to join. [[Theodore 'Ted' Kord]], [[Beatriz 'Fire' da Costa]] and [[Tora 'Ice' Olafsdotter]] encourage Hal to join and replace [[Guy Gardner]] as the current Green Lantern on the team (much to Guy's annoyance). Hal refuses and cites the fact that he's busy, however Bruce privately questions this and Hal admits that he's been feeling stressed from his life as a superhero and is taking a break from it all to re-adjust to normal life before leaving again.

We get a single page featuring [[John Stewart]], who seems to be grappling with his own problems regarding the Green Lantern title before switching back to Hal.
