This issue continues off from the last, cutting straight to the clone of [[Wallace 'Wally' West]] attacking and being aggressive towards [[Richard 'Dick' Grayson]], [[Dinah Lance]], [[Linda Park-West]], [[Wade West]], [[Wade West - Unknown Universe]], [[Iris 'Irey' West II]] and INSERT OTHER CHARACTERS HERE. However, before anything more serious can occur, [[Wallace 'Ace' West]], [[Bartholomew 'Bart' Allen II]], [[Max Mercury]] and [[Avery Ho]] arrive and corral Wally into not moving so that [[Clark 'Kal-El' Kent]] can boom-tube him away from anyone and act as a distraction so [[Oliver 'Ollie' Queen]] can supress him using [[Gorilla Grodd]] technology. Linda argues against this, saying that the plan won't work and Wally will likely be too powerful to be restrained by such means.

The perspective changes to the original Wally, who is being beaten by INSERT CHARACTER NAME with [[Eclipso]] watching and commentating. Wally looks to be close to death before Linda, Wade and Irey burst through using a gadget stolen from future Wade to distract LADY HERE. [[Jai West]] and [[Foxy]] also rejoin the group as Wally takes advantage of this to go back to fighting and knocks LADY LIZARD back.

Linda reveals that Doctor Occult granted her the power to speak Alantean and uses the power to speak to LIZARD LADY and try and convince her that Eclipso is not on her side, and wishes to take advantage of her.

We cut to the clone of Wally and the grown Wade, they are floating through alternate planes due to the Justice League's interference and technology. Wade had followed after Wally to find him, but Wally enters a frequency out of Wade's reach after revealing that the alternate planes are alive.

We return to the other scene; with LIZARD LADY confronting Eclipso, who admits to his plans. LIZARD LADY reacts negatively to this and destroys the object which held all the loathing and hatred. Eclipso plans to kill and consume the power of the Flash family for his own, but Foxy interrupts and reveals his own powers to take on Eclipso in defence of his "pack". Foxy presumably is killed by Eclipso and the place starts to fall apart, Jai manages to teleport them away to the moon before they sustain any damage.

Linda and Wally start to talk, before clone-Wally interrupts and warns Wally of Eclipso's danger. He urges them to re-merge, and start to before the original Wally hears a distant bark from Foxy in the speedforce and gets distracted, causing clone-Wally's death when Eclipso comes and eats him. Eclipso announces his new rise under the name Meliophage and warns Earth of what's to come.
