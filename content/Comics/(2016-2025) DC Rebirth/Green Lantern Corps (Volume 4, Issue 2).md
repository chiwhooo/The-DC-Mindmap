[[John Stewart]], [[Kilowog]], [[Razer]] and [[Shayera Thal]] are flying towards [[Thangar]] at the request of political help, to which we find the planet half destroyed and falling apart. Shayera discusses the impact of the Red Lantern's powers who caused this, which prompts Razer and Kilowog to talk about how the destruction of the energy batteries has made controlling their emotions and powers even more difficult. However, the conversation is interrupted by a [[Red Lantern Corps]] ship.
