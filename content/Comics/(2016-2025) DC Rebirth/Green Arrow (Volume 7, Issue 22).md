The opening is an TV advertisement by politician [[Eustace Foley]], revealing the new and affordable housing location of 'Freshwater'. It's interrupted by the reveal we are watching this from a support group composed of those effected by the poisoning to the water, most of which are ill, dying or their loved ones have passed. The speaker is revealed to be [[Kenny Gordon]], the grown figure of the young boy from the first couple of comics who is rallying other victims at the group.

We then switch back to [[Oliver 'Ollie' Queen]]'s point of view, watching as **(INSERT NAME HERE)** is being arrested and taken away by the police. He's briefly questioned but is brushed off as just another dumb billionaire and dismissed with a simple request to come back for further questioning.

We switch again to Detective [[Benny Benítez]], who is currently investigating the abandoned town of Freshwater with her dog, Arrow. She is swarmed by armed figures, all dressed in the gear of the Freshwater killer; she makes an attempt to fight back but her and Arrow are quickly overrun. Oliver arrives a bit after this, and finds Benítez's car abandoned and Arrow injured and hiding by it, he puts Arrow in the car before going in search of what's happening.
