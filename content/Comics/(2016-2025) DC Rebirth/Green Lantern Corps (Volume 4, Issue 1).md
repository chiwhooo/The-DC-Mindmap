The comic opens with [[John Stewart]] arresting and interrupting an alien child trafficking ring, and noting that the 'United Planets' are currently in disarray and chaotic; without order due to the reopening of [[Sector 2814]] which has started trade routes again and as a result larger scale crimes. [[Sojourner 'Jo' Mullein]] talks to John, trying to encourage him to talk about his feelings and what has been happening in his life currently; as he's going through a stressful period but John refuses to talk about it, brushing off her concerns.

It moves to a scene of [[Jessica Cruz]] and [[Simon Baz]], with Simon encouraging Jess to accept help with her new role as the captain of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] as she is overworking herself and can't keep up with it all. Jessica accepts the offer to take on more help from others, thanking Simon for his words before rushing off to a meeting with Simon, John, [[Guy Gardner]], [[Keli Quintela]], the [[Guardians of the Universe]] and a construct of John's younger sister, Ellie.

Jess starts the meeting with talking about their current concern and main villain, an aberration in the emotional spectrum called [[Nathan 'The Sorrow' Broome]] who plans to create a power battery capable of destroying the universe. Guy was able to find a list of objects that he will likely need to create it, and Green Lantern guards are currently being stationed to protect the objects.

It's also discussed that there is currently a large surge in fear energy on [[Tamaran]], which is dangerous considering their alien physiology so John is set to head a mission to discover what is causing it with the help of [[Thaal Sinestro]] (much to John's dismay).

On Tamaran, they run into the current queen, [[Komand'r 'Blackfire']], who is against Green Lantern interference and is antagonised further by Sinestro. The source of the fear energy and destruction is being caused by a Tamaranian called Vexar'u the Zealot, who was so afraid of their God and that she would be deemed unworthy she had manifested that being. Sinestro manages to calm her down and grants her a Green Lantern power ring in recognition of her capability to overcome her fear. 

When the return to [[Oa]], they discuss their findings with the others. It's decided that they are going to try and recruit more individuals who are capable of using other emotional energy (at the encouragement of Sinestro and John). Jess then tells John that he has been requested by [[Thangar]]ians for a political mission to help restore their home world and is greeted by [[Shayera Thal]].
