The issue starts with Hal at work as a test pilot, before his incorporeal form is summoned to face the [[Guardians of the Universe]] and goes over his history so far as the Green Lantern so the Guardians can decide if Hal is a suitable candidate. The Guardians declare that Hal is worthy of the title and temporarily remove the memory of the interview from his mind.

Hal is returned to Earth and continues about his workday, before the lantern summons him to help handle an emergency in his sector on the planet [[Calor]]. The inhabitants of the planet assume that Hal is a blessing granted from a tree they were praying to, and tell him of the threat '[[Dryg]]'.

As Dryg appears, Hal finds his powers falter against the being as a result of it's strong mental energy which saps his will-power. Hal manages to weaken the beast however by using liquid oxygen and taking advantage of the cold to freeze him. He leaves Dryg to freeze in Calor's polar ice cap and returns to Earth with a successful mission completed.
